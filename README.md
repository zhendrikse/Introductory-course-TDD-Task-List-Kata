You should be able to give the list with tasks the following commands:

1. Deadlines
  - Give each task an optional deadline with the `deadline <ID> <date>` command.
  - Show all tasks due today with the `today` command.
2. Customisable IDs
  - Allow the user to specify an identifier that’s not a number.
  - Disallow spaces and special characters from the ID.
3. Deletion
  - Allow users to delete tasks with the `delete <ID>` command.
4. Views
  - View tasks by date with the `view by date` command.
  - View tasks by deadline with the `view by deadline` command.
